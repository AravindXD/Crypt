# 🔐 Cryptography Algorithms

## 📜 Algorithms list

The following algorithms have been implemented so far:

1. **Additive Cipher** (`Additive.py`)  
   A basic implementation of the additive cipher (shift cipher), which performs encryption and decryption by shifting characters by a specified key.

2. **Playfair Cipher** (`PlayfairEncrypt.py`)  
   An implementation of the Playfair cipher, which encrypts text based on a 5x5 matrix of alphabets derived from a keyword.

3. **Vigenère Cipher** (`Vignere.py`)  
   Implements the Vigenère cipher, which uses a repeated keyword to perform multi-alphabet substitution.

## 📚 About the Course

This repository is part of the **BCSE309P - Cryptography and Network Security Lab** at VIT Chennai. The course focuses on understanding and implementing foundational cryptographic algorithms and network security techniques. As the course progresses, more algorithms will be added and updated in this repository.
